OT-2 Python Protocol API Version 2
==================================

The OT-2 Python Protocol API is a simple Python framework designed to
make writing automated biology lab protocols easy.

We've designed it in a way we hope is accessible to anyone with basic
Python and wetlab skills. As a bench scientist, you should be able to
code your automated protocols in a way that reads like a lab notebook.

Version 2 of the API is a new way to write Python protocols. It is more
reliable, simpler, and better able to be supported. Unlike version 1, it
has support for new modules like the Thermocycler. While version 1 will
still recieve bug fixes, new features and improvements will land in
version 2. For a guide on transitioning your protocols from version 1 to
version 2 of the API, see [this article on
migration](http://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3425727-switching-your-protocols-from-api-version-1-to-version-2).
For a more in-depth discussion of why version 2 of the API was developed
and what is different about it compared to version 1, see [this article
on why we wrote API
V2](http://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3418212-opentrons-protocol-api-version-2).

Overview
--------

### How it Looks

The design goal of this API is to make code readable and easy to
understand. For example, below is a short set of instructions to
transfer from well `'A1'` to well `'B1'` that even a computer could
understand:

> This protocol is by me; it's called Opentrons Protocol Tutorial and is
> used for demonstrating the OT-2 Python Protocol API. It uses version
> 2.0 of this API.
>
> Begin the protocol
>
> Add a 96 well plate, and place it in slot '2' of the robot deck
>
> Add a 300 µL tip rack, and place it in slot '1' of the robot deck
>
> Add a single-channel 300 µL pipette to the left mount, and tell it to
> use that tip rack
>
> Transfer 100 µL from the plate's 'A1' well to its 'B2' well

If we were to rewrite this with the Python Protocol API, it would look
like the following:



``` python
from opentrons import protocol_api

# metadata
metadata = {
    'protocolName': 'My Protocol',
    'author': 'Name <email@address.com>',
    'description': 'Simple protocol to get started using OT2',
    'apiLevel': '{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}'
}

# protocol run function. the part after the colon lets your editor know
# where to look for autocomplete suggestions
def run(protocol: protocol_apiProtocolContext):

    # labware
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', '2')
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')

    # pipettes
    left_pipette = protocol.load_instrument(
         'p300_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    # commands
    left_pipette.pick_up_tip()
    left_pipette.aspirate(100, plate['A1'])
    left_pipette.dispense(100, plate['B2'])
    left_pipette.drop_tip()
```

### How it's Organized

When writing protocols using the Python Protocol API, there are
generally five sections:

1.  Metadata and Version Selection
2.  Run function
3.  Labware
4.  Pipettes
5.  Commands

#### Metadata and Version Selection

Metadata is a dictionary of data that is read by the server and returned
to client applications (such as the Opentrons App). Most metadata is not
needed to run a protocol, but if present can help the Opentrons App
display additional data about the protocol currently being executed.
These optional (but recommended) fields are (`"protocolName"`,
`"author"`, and `"description"`).

The required element of the metadata is `"apiLevel"`. This must contain
a string specifying the major and minor version of the Python Protocol
API that your protocol is designed for. For instance, a protocol written
for version 2.0 of the Python Protocol API (only launch version of the
Protocol API should have in its metadata `"apiLevel": "2.0"`.

For more information on Python Protocol API versioning, see
[Versioning](versioning.md).

#### The Run Function and the Protocol Context

Protocols are structured around a function called `run(protocol)`,
defined in code like this:

``` python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {'apiLevel': '{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}'}

def run(protocol: protocol_apiProtocolContext):
    pass
```

This function must be named exactly `run` and must take exactly one
mandatory argument (its name doesn't matter, but we recommend `protocol`
since this argument represents the protocol that the robot will
execute).

The function `run` is the container for the code that defines your
protocol.

The object `protocol` is the *protocol context*, which represents the
robot and its capabilities. It is always an instance of the
`opentrons.protocol_api.contextsProtocolContext` class (though you'll never have to instantiate one
yourself - it is always passed in to `run()`), and it is tagged as such
in the example protocol to allow most editors to give you autocomplete.

The protocol context has two responsibilities:

1.  Remember, track, and check the robot's state
2.  Expose the functions that make the robot execute actions

The protocol context plays the same role as the `robot`, `labware`,
`instruments`, and `modules` objects in past versions of the API, with
one important difference: it is only one object; and because it is
passed in to your protocol rather than imported, it is possible for the
API to be much more rigorous about separating simulation from reality.

The key point is that there is no longer any need to `import opentrons`
at the top of every protocol, since the *robot* now *runs the protocol*,
rather than the *protocol running the robot*. The example protocol
imports the definition of the protocol context to provide editors with
autocomplete sources.

#### Labware

The next step is defining the labware required for your protocol. You
must tell the protocol context about what should be present on the deck,
and where. You tell the protocol context about labware by calling the
method `protocol.load_labware(name, slot)` and saving the result.

The name of a labware is a string that is different for each kind of
labware. You can look up labware to add to your protocol on the
Opentrons [Labware Library](https://labware.opentrons.com).

The slot is the labelled location on the deck in which you've placed
the labware. The available slots are numbered from 1-11.

Our example protocol above loads

-   a [Corning 96 Well
    Plate](https://labware.opentrons.com/corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat)
    in slot 2:

``` python
plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_360ul_flat', 2)
```

-   an [Opentrons 300µL
    Tiprack](https://labware.opentrons.com/opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul)
    in slot 1:

``` python
tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', 1)
```

These labware can be referenced later in the protocol as `plate` and
`tiprack` respectively. Check out [the Python
docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html) for further clarification on
using variables effectively in your code.

You can find more information about handling labware in the
[Labware](new_labware.md) section.

#### Pipettes

After defining labware, you define the instruments required for your
protocol. You tell the protocol context about which pipettes should be
attached, and which slot they should be attached to, by calling the
method `protocol.load_instrument(model, mount, tip_racks)` and saving
the result.

The `model` of the pipette is the kind of pipette that should be
attached; the `mount` is either `"left"` or `"right"`; and `tip_racks`
is a list of the objects representing tip racks that this instrument
should use. Specifying `tip_racks` is optional, but if you don't then
you'll have to manually specify where the instrument should pick up
tips from every time you try and pick up a tip.

See [Pipettes](new_pipette.md) for more information on
creating and working with pipettes.

Our example protocol above loads a P300 Single-channel pipette
(`'p300_single'`) in the left mount (`'left'`), and uses the Opentrons
300 µL tiprack we loaded previously as a source of tips
(`tip_racks=[tiprack]`).

#### Commands

Once the instruments and labware required for the protocol are defined,
the next step is to define the commands that make up the protocol. The
most common commands are `aspirate()`, `dispense()`, `pick_up_tip()`,
and `drop_tip()`. These and many others are described in the
[Building Block Commands](new_atomic_commands.md) and
[Complex Commands](new_complex_commands.md) sections, which go
into more detail about the commands and how they work. These commands
typically specify which wells of which labware to interact with, using
the labware you defined earlier, and are methods of the instruments you
created in the pipette section. For instance, in our example protocol,
you use the pipette you defined to:

1.  Pick up a tip (implicitly from the tiprack you specified in slot 1
    and assigned to the pipette): `pipette.pick_up_tip()`
2.  Aspirate 100 µL from well A1 of the 96 well plate you specified in
    slot 2: `pipette.aspirate(100, plate['A1'])`
3.  Dispense 100 µL into well A2 of the 96 well plate you specified in
    slot 2: `pipette.dispense(100, plate['A2'])`
4.  Drop the tip (implicitly into the trash at the back right of the
    robot's deck): `pipette.drop_tip()`
