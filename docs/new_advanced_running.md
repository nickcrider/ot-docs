# Running the OT-2 Without the App

Sometimes, you may write a protocol that is not suitable for execution
through the Opentrons App. Perhaps it requires user input; perhaps it
needs to do a lot of things it cannot do when being simulated. There are
two ways to run a protocol on the OT-2 without using the Opentrons App:

- The Robot's pre-installed Jupyter Notebook
- The Robot's command line

To use either of these techniques, you'll need a [good understanding of how  
calibration works on the OT-2](examples/calibration.md).
