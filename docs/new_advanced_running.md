Advanced Control
================

Sometimes, you may write a protocol that is not suitable for execution
through the Opentrons App. Perhaps it requires user input; perhaps it
needs to do a lot of things it cannot do when being simulated. There are
two ways to run a protocol on the OT-2 without using the Opentrons App.

Jupyter Notebook
----------------

The OT-2 runs a Jupyter Notebook server that you can connect to with
your web browser. This is a convenient environment in which to write and
debug protocols, since you can define different parts of your protocol
in different notebook cells and run only part of the protocol at a given
time.

You can access the OT-2's Jupyter Notebook by following these steps:

1.  Open your Opentrons App and look for the IP address of your OT-2 on
    the information page.
2.  Type in `(Your OT-2's IP Address):48888` into any browser on your
    computer.

Here, you can select a notebook and develop protocols that will be saved
on the OT-2 itself. These protocols will only be on the OT-2 unless
specifically downloaded to your computer using the `File / Download As`
buttons in the notebook.

### Protocol Structure

To take advantage of Jupyter's ability to run only parts of your
protocol, you have to restructure your protocol - turn it inside out.
Rather than writing a single `run` function that contains all your
protocol logic, you can use the function
`opentrons.execute.get_protocol_api`,
into which you pass the same API version (see
[Versioning](versioning.md)) that you would specify in
your protocol's metadata:

```python
import opentrons.execute
protocol = opentrons.execute.get_protocol_api('{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}')
protocol.home()
```

This returns the same kind of object - a
`ProtocolContext` - that is passed
into your protocol's `run` function when you upload your protocol in
the Opentrons App. Full documentation on the capabilities and use of the
`ProtocolContext` object is
available in the other sections of this guide -
[Pipettes](new_pipette.md),
[Building Block Commands](new_atomic_commands.md),
[Complex Commands](new_complex_commands.md),
[Labware](new_labware.md), and
[Hardware Modules](new_modules.md); a full list of all
available attributes and methods is available in
[API Version 2 Reference](new_protocol_api.md).

Whenever you call `get_protocol_api`, the robot will update its cache of
attached instruments and modules. You can call `get_protocol_api`
repeatedly; it will return an entirely new
`ProtocolContext` each time, without
any labware loaded or any instruments established. This can be a good
way to reset the state of the system, if you accidentally loaded in the
wrong labware.

Now that you have a `ProtocolContext`, you call all its methods just as you would in a protocol,
without the encompassing `run` function, just like if you were
prototyping a plotting or pandas script for later use.

!!! Note
    Before you can command the OT-2 to move using the protocol API you have
    just built, you must home the robot using `protocol.home()`. If you try
    to move the OT-2 before you have called `protocol.home()`, you will get
    a `MustHomeError`.


### Running A Previously-Written Protocol

If you have a protocol that you have already written you can run it
directly in Jupyter. Copy the protocol into a cell and execute it - this
won't cause the OT-2 to move, it just makes the function available.
Then, call the `run` function you just defined, and give it a
`ProtocolContext`:

```python
import opentrons.execute
from opentrons import protocol_api
def run(protocol: protocol_apiProtocolContext):
    # the contents of your protocol are here...

protocol = opentrons.execute.get_protocol_api('{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}')
run(protocol)  # your protocol will now run
```

### Custom Labware

If you have custom labware definitions you want to use with Jupyter,
make a new directory called "labware" in Jupyter and put the
definitions there. These definitions will be available when you call
`load_labware`.

Command Line
------------

The OT-2's command line is accessible either by creating a new terminal
in Jupyter or by [using SSH to access its
terminal](https://support.opentrons.com/en/articles/3203681).

To execute a protocol via SSH, copy it to the OT-2 using a program like
`scp` and then use the command line program `opentrons_execute`:


```bash
opentrons_execute /data/my_protocol.py
```

If you want to invoke `opentrons_execute` in a remote SSH session, you
need to use a login shell to get the proper environment variables:

```bash
ssh <root@$ROBOT_IP> 'sh -l -c "opentrons_execute /data/my_protocol.py"'
```

You can access help on the usage of `opentrons_execute` by calling
`opentrons_execute --help`. This script has a couple options to let you
customize what it prints out when you run it. By default, it will print
out the same runlog you see in the Opentrons App when running a
protocol, as it executes; it will also print out internal logs at level
`warning` or above. Both of these behaviors can be changed.
