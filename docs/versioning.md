# Versioning

The OT-2 Python Protocol API has its own versioning system, which is
separated from the version of the OT-2 software or of the Opentrons App.
This separation allows you to specify the Protocol API version your
protocol requires without being concerned with what OT-2 software
versions it will work with, and allows Opentrons to version the Python
Protocol API based only on changes that affect protocols.

!!! Tip
    While we increase the maximum available API Version when add new 
    features, your protocol will continue to have the same pipetting 
    performance as long as your protocol's `'apiLevel'` remains the same.

The API is versioned with a major and minor version, expressed like
this: `major.minor`. For instance, major version 2 and minor version 0
is written as `2.0`. Versions aren't decimal numbers. Major version 2
and minor version 10 is written as `2.10`, while `2.1` means major
version 2 and minor version 1.

## Major and Minor Version

The major version of the API is increased whenever there are significant
structural or behavioral changes to protocols. For instance, major
version 2 of the API was introduced because protocols must now have a
`run` function that takes a `protocol` argument rather than importing
the `robot`, `instruments`, and `labware` modules. A similar level of
structural change would require a major version 3. Another major version
bump would be if all of the default units switched to nanoliters instead
of microliters (we won't do this, it's just an example). This major
behavioral change would also require a major version 3.

The minor version of the API is increased whenever we add new
functionality that might change the way a protocol is written, or when
we want to make a behavior change to an aspect of the API but not the
whole thing. For instance, if we added support for a new module, added
an option for specifying volume units in the `aspirate` and `dispense`
functions, or added a way to queue up actions from multiple different
modules and execute them at the same time, we would increase the minor
version of the API. Another minor version bump would be if we added
automatic liquid level tracking, and the position at which the OT-2
aspirated from wells was now dynamic - some people might not want that
change appearing suddenly in their well-tested protocol, so we would
increase the minor version.

!!! Note
    The current API Version at the time of writing is: `{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}`

## Expressing Versions

You must specify the API version you are targeting at the top of your
Python protocol. This is done in the `metadata` block, using the key
`'apiLevel'`:

``` python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}',
    'author': 'A. Biologist'}

def run(protocol: protocol_apiProtocolContext):
    pass
```

This key exists alongside the other elements of the metadata.

!!! Warning
    Version specification is required by the system. If you don't specify
    your target API version, you won't be able to simulate or run your
    protocol.

The version you specify determines the features and behaviors available
to your protocol. For instance, if Opentrons adds the ability to set the
volume units in a call to `aspirate` in version 2.1, then you must
specify version 2.1 in your metadata. A protocol like this:

``` python
from opentrons import protocol_api

metadata = {
    'apiLevel': '2.0',
    'author': 'A. Biologist'}

def run(protocol: protocol_apiProtocolContext):
    tiprack = protocol.load_labware('opentrons_96_tiprack_300ul', '1')
    plate = protocol.load_labware('corning_96_wellplate_380ul', '2')
    left = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'left', tip_racks=[tiprack])

    left.pick_up_tip()
    left.aspirate(volume=50000, location=plate['A1'], units='nanoliters')
```

would cause an error, because the `units` argument isn't present in API
version 2.0 (or in any version, it's just an example). This protects you 
from accidentally using features not present in your specified API version, 
and keeps your protocol portable between API versions.

In general, you should closely consider what features you need in your
protocol, and keep your specified API level as low as possible. This
makes your protocol work on a wider range of OT-2 software versions.

## Determining What Version Is Available

Since version 3.15.0 of the OT-2 software and Opentrons App, the maximum
supported API level of your OT-2 is visible in the Information card in
the Opentrons App for your OT-2.

This maximum supported API level is the highest API level you can
specify in a protocol. If you upload a protocol that specifies a higher
API level than the OT-2 software supports, the OT-2 can't simulate or
run your protocol.

## Determining What Features Are In What Version

As you read the documentation on this site, you will notice that all
documentation on features, function calls, available properties, and
everything else about the Python Protocol API notes which API version it
was introduced in. Keep this information in mind when specifying your
protocol's API version. The version statement will look like this:

_New in version 2.0_

## API and OT-2 Software Versions

This table lists the correspondence between Protocol API versions and
robot software versions.

| API Version | Introduced In OT-2 Software |
| ----------- | :-------------------------: |
| 1.0         | 3.0.0                       |
| 2.0         | 3.14.0                      |

| 2.4         | 3.17.1                      |
| 2.5         | 3.19.0                      |
| 2.6         | 3.20.0                      |

## Changes in API Versions

### Version 2.1

-   You can now specify a label when loading labware into a module with
    the `label` parameter of `ModuleContext.load_labware()` just
    like you can when loading labware into your protocol with
    `ProtocolContext.load_labware()`.

### Version 2.2

-   You should now specify magnetic module engage height using the
    `height_from_base` parameter, which specifies the height of the top
    of the magnet from the base of the labware. For more, see
    [Engage](modules/magnet.md#engage).
-   Return tip will now use pre-defined heights from hardware testing.
    For more information, see [Return Tip](building_block/tip_handling.md#return-tip).
-   When using the return tip function, tips are no longer added back
    into the tip tracker. For more information, see
    see [Return Tip](building_block/tip_handling.md#return-tip).

### Version 2.3

-   Magnetic Modules GEN2 and Temperature Modules GEN2 are now
    supported; you can load them with the names `"magnetic module gen2"`
    and `"temperature module gen2"`, respectively
-   All pipettes will return tips to tipracks from a higher position to
    avoid possible collisions
-   During a `mix()`, the pipette will no
    longer move up to clear the liquid in between every dispense and
    following aspirate
-   You can now access the temperature module's status via the `status`
    property of `ModuleContext.TemperatureModuleContext`

### Version 2.4   

The following improvements were made to the [`touch_tip()`](building_block/liquid_control.md#touch-tip) command:

- The speed for `touch_tip()` can now be lowered down to 1 mm/s
- `touch_tip()` no longer moves diagonally from the X direction -\> Y direction
- Takes into account geometry of the deck and modules

### Version 2.5

New [Utility Commands](building_block/utility.md) were added:

-   `ProtocolContext.set_rail_lights()`: turns robot rail lights on or off
-   `ProtocolContext.rail_lights_on`: describes whether or not the rail lights are on
-   `ProtocolContext.door_closed`: describes whether the robot door is closed

### Version 2.6

-   GEN2 Single pipettes now default to flow rates equivalent to 10 mm/s
    plunger speeds - Protocols that manually configure pipette flow
    rates will be unaffected - For a comparison between API Versions,
    see [Defaults](pipettes/defaults.md)
