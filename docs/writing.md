Using Python For Protocols
==========================

Writing protocols in Python requires some up-front design before seeing
your liquid handling automation in action. At a high-level, writing
protocols with the OT-2 Python Protocol API looks like:

1.  Write a Python protocol
2.  Test the code for errors
3.  Repeat steps 1 & 2
4.  Calibrate labware on your OT-2
5.  Run your protocol

These sets of documents aim to help you get the most out of steps 1 & 2,
the "design" stage.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

Python for Beginners
--------------------

If Python is new to you, we suggest going through a few simple tutorials
to acquire a base understanding to build upon. The following tutorials
are a great starting point for working with the Protocol API (from
[learnpython.org](http://www.learnpython.org/)):

1)  [Hello World](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Hello%2C_World%21)
2)  [Variables and
    Types](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Variables_and_Types)
3)  [Lists](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Lists)
4)  [Basic Operators](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Basic_Operators)
5)  [Conditions](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Conditions)
6)  [Loops](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Loops)
7)  [Functions](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Functions)
8)  [Dictionaries](http://www.learnpython.org/en/Dictionaries)

After going through the above tutorials, you should have enough of an
understanding of Python to work with the Protocol API and start
designing your experiments! More detailed information on Python can
always be found at [the Python
docs](https://docs.python.org/3/index.html)

Working with Python
-------------------

Using a popular and free code editor, like [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/), is a common method for writing
Python protocols. Download onto your computer, and you can now write
Python scripts.

!!! Note
    Make sure that when saving a protocol file, it ends with the `.py` file
    extension. This will ensure the Opentrons App and other programs are
    able to properly read it.

    For example, `my_protocol.py`


Simulating Python Protocols
---------------------------

In general, the best way to simulate a protocol is to simply upload it
to your OT-2 through the Opentrons App. When you upload a protocol via
the app, the OT-2 simulates the protocol and the app displays any
errors. However, if you want to simulate protocols without being
connected to an OT-2, you can download the Opentrons Python package.

### Installing

To install the Opentrons package, you must install it from Python's
package manager, `pip`. The exact method of installation is
slightly different depending on whether you use Jupyter on your computer
(note: you do not need to do this if you want to use the
[Robot's Jupyer Notebook](new_advanced_running.md), ONLY for your
locally-installed notebook) or not.

#### Non-Jupyter Installation

First, install Python 3.7.6 ([Windows
x64](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-amd64.exe),
[Windows x86](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6.exe),
[OS
X](https://www.python.org/ftp/python/3.7.6/python-3.7.6-macosx10.6.pkg))
or higher on your local computer.

Once the installer is done, make sure that Python is properly installed
by opening a terminal and doing `python --version`. If this is not
higher than 3.7.6, you have another version of Python installed; this
happens frequently on OS X and sometimes on Windows. We recommend using
a tool like [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage multiple
Python versions. This is particularly useful on OS X, which has a
built-in install of Python 2.7 that should not be removed.

Once Python is installed, install the [opentrons
package](https://pypi.org/project/opentrons/) using `pip`:


```bash
pip install opentrons
```

You should see some output that ends with
`Successfully installed opentrons-{! version_info/build.txt !}`

#### Jupyter Installation

You must make sure that you install the `opentrons` package for
whichever kernel and virtual environment the notebook is using. A
generally good way to do this is

```python

import sys
!{sys.executable} -m pip install opentrons
```

### Simulating Your Scripts

#### From the Command Line

Once the Opentrons Python package is installed, you can simulate
protocols in your terminal using the `opentrons_simulate` command:

=== "MacOS/Linux"

    ```bash

    opentrons_simulate my_protocol.py
    ```

=== "Windows"

    ```bash

    opentrons_simulate.exe my_protocol.py
    ```

The simulator will print out a log of the actions the protocol will
cause, similar to the Opentrons App; it will also print out any log
messages caused by a given command next to that list of actions. If
there is a problem with the protocol, the simulation will stop and the
error will be printed.

The simulation script can also be invoked through python:

```bash

python -m opentrons.simulate /path/to/protocol
```

`opentrons_simulate` has several command line options that might be
useful. Most options are explained below, but to see all options you can
run

```bash

opentrons_simulate --help
```

#### Using Custom Labware

By default, `opentrons_simulate` will load custom labware definitions
from the directory in which you run it. You can change the directory
`opentrons_simulate` searches for custom labware with the
`--custom-labware-path` option:

``` {.sourceCode .shell}
python.exe -m opentrons.simulate --custom-labware-path="C:\Custom Labware"
```

#### In the Python Shell

The Opentrons Python package also provides an entrypoint to use the
Opentrons simulation package from other Python contexts such as an
interactive prompt or Jupyter. To simulate a protocol in Python, open a
file containing a protocol and pass it to
`opentrons.simulate.simulate`:

``` python
from opentrons.simulate import simulate, format_runlog
# read the file
protocol_file = open('/path/to/protocol.py')
# simulate() the protocol, keeping the runlog
runlog, _bundle = simulate(protocol_file)
# print the runlog
print(format_runlog(runlog))
```

The `opentrons.simulate.simulate`
method does the work of simulating the protocol and returns the run log,
which is a list of structured dictionaries.
`opentrons.simulate.format_runlog`
turns that list of dictionaries into a human readable string, which is
then printed out. For more information on the protocol simulator, see
[Simulating Your Scripts](writing.md).

#### Using Jupyter

In your Jupyter notebook, you can use the Python Protocol API simulator
by doing

```python
from opentrons import simulate
protocol = simulate.get_protocol_api('{! version_info/apilevel.txt !}')
p300 = protocol.load_instrument('p300_single', 'right')
# ...
```

The `protocol` object, which is an instance of
`ProtocolContext`, is the same thing
that gets passed to your protocol's `run` function, but set to simulate
rather than control an OT-2. You can call all your protocol's functions
on that object.

If you have a full protocol, wrapped inside a `run` function, defined in
a Jupyter cell you can also use
`opentrons.simulate.simulate` as
described above to simulate the protocol.

These instructions also work on the OT-2's Jupyter notebook. This can
also be used in the Python interactive shell.

### Configuration and Local Storage

The Opentrons Python package uses a folder in your user directory as a
place to store and read configuration and changes to its internal data.
This location is `~/.opentrons` on Linux or OSX and
`C:\Users\%USERNAME%\.opentrons` on Windows.

Robot's Jupyter Notebook
------------------------

Your OT-2 also has a Jupyter notebook, which you can use to develop and
execute protocols. For more information on how to execute protocols
using the OT-2's Jupyter notebook, please see
[Advanced Control](new_advanced_running.md). To simulate protocols
on the OT-2's Jupyter notebook, use the instructions above.
